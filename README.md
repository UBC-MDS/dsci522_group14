# Credit Card Fraud Detection

-   Author: Jenny Lee, Shawn X. Hu, Koray Tecimer, Iris Luo

Contains an analytical report generated for Milestone 1 of DSCI 522, a course offered through the Master of Data Science program at the University of British Columbia.

## About

Through this project, we attempted to build three classification models capable of distinguishing between fraud and non-fraud transactions, as indicated on customer accounts. Data preprocessing steps are also described in `fraud_detection.ipynb`. The models we experimented with include logistic regression, random forest classifier, and gradient boost classifier. Due to an extreme imbalance in our data, we encountered challenges in developing an effective model in milestone 1. In the discussion, we have provided some suggestions for future steps.

## Data

Our data is sourced from the [Capital One GitHub for Data Scientist Recruitment](https://github.com/CapitalOneRecruiting/DS). The data consists of 786,363 entries of synthetically generated data.

As depicted in the graph above, our dataset exhibits a significant imbalance. The imbalanced nature of the data significantly affected the performance of our models, preventing them from achieving a high scoring metric value (f1).
